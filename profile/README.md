# Advanced Dynamics and Control Group

The Advanced Dynamics and Control (ADC) Group focuses on the development and implementation of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems for aerospace applications, along with research in a broad range of topics in flight dynamics.

Our mission is to advance aviation and space technologies through the development of new concepts, the implementation of innovative solutions, and the demonstration of practical applications.  

## Research Areas
Our research efforts span several areas, including but not limited to:

- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) integration into the National Airspace System (NAS)  
- Intelligent systems to increase aviation flight safety  
- Robotic technologies for future space missions  
- Manned and unmanned aerospace systems development  
- Avionics and payload systems design  
- Aircraft modeling and parameter identification  
- Multiple sensor fusion  
- Formation flight control  
- Humanâ€“machine interfaces  
- Remote sensing applications
